# JTimeSelector
<p>
JTimeSelector is a (Java Swing) JPanel which displays a timeline with layers. Each layer is defined by a name and a set of points (time instants) which are drawn on the timeline.
</p>
<p>
The user can zoom in using mousewheel, select a single time value by clicking on the timeline and select a time interval by dragging the mouse  over the component. 
</p>
<p>The component was created for my application DroneFlightInspector. It was initially designed to support multiple types of layers. However, currently, only  a simple TimeValuesLayer is implemented. The class JTimeSelector contains main method which can serve as an example of usage.
